Currently, we accept content submissions in the form of desktop and phone wallpapers. In order to maintain the quality of our content offerings, only a subset of submissions are selected to be published to publicly accessible portions of the web site.</p>
        <p>Some of ARR Wallpapers' content may be commented on publicly, with user-submitted text appearing directly on the site, associated with the appropriate content. It is the intention of the operators and architects of this site that the commenting feature be used only for constructive feedback and other discussions directly related to the content in question. It is not to be used for personal insults, explicit or implied, off-topic discussions, racially or culturally insensitive material, sexual content, or other material not suited for a family audience including small children. Additionally, we ask that personally identifiable information not be posted to the web site, regardless of whether it pertains to yourself or another individual. Children under the age of 13 shall only post comments or other content under the supervision of a parent, guardian, or other responsible adult.</p>

Moderation criteria may vary over time.</p>
        <h2>Prohibited Content</h2>
        <p>ARR Wallpapers is meant to be a family-safe website, which means that we don't accept content submissions which contain pornography, adult or mature content, hate speech, content that advocates against an individual, group, or organization, content that promotes weapons (not the hobby/movie/games content type, just the trigger-happy type of content), depictions of gratuitous violence, gore, bloodshed, or gruesome images, images that promote the use of drugs or drug paraphernalia, copyrighted material (content for which you don't have the necessary legal rights to display). If we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that your content qualifies as such, we may remove or suspend your content or account.</p>

        <p>The operators of the web site make a reasonable attempt to maintain the availability and performance of ARR Wallpapers and its associated services. However, uptime and accessibility cannot be guaranteed. The web site may occasionally be inaccessible, in whole or in part, due to planned or emergency maintenance, feature upgrades, bug fixes, server migrations, hardware upgrades and failures, or simply to prevent unauthorized use, hacking, or exploitation of the web site, or its resources.</p>

        <p>ARR Wallpapers, its owners, employees, contractors, and partners shall not be held legally liable or financially responsible for any loss, damage, or injury incurred as a result of the use or existence of ARR Wallpapers, its associated sites, content, services, or infrastructure.</p>
